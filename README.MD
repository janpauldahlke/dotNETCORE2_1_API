this is a little fun repo

i try here to expose an api form .net core 2.1  
then cosume it with a react app  
the telos of this approach is to keep everything in the visual studio environment  

to to it navigate clone the repo  
navigate into the CORE_2_1_API folder, press start in debug mode
there sould be, if WINDOOFS world is wokring correct, an API exposed to ```localhost:4400/api/todo```
there is also a swagger documentation on `localhost:4400/swagger`  
yes, its a small API, just for testing purposes

then have the visual studio npm taskrunner installed, adjust node via PATH to your needs in taskrunner settings  
navigate into the folder react-app
either use bash (better way) or the taskrunner, press/click the start script
have a lifewatcher provided to you thingy

have fun with it
